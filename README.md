MPC Maid is a software editor for the Akai MPC 1000, MPC 2500, and MPC 500, for Mac, PC, and other platforms (Java) 

- Switch between the MPC 500 12-pads layout or the MPC 1000 16-pads layout (also takes care of the correct number of filters and sliders thanks to the built-in machine profiles).

- Simply drag and drop your samples files onto the pads, and it automatically assigns them, one on each pad or one on each sample layer.

- Export the full program and every related sample file together to the target location of your choice.

- Also features a semi-automatic slicing tool: drop your loop file to have it chopped into slices based on a beat detection mechanism.

- Direct export of the chopped slices as multiple .WAV files, one corresponding .PGM program file and one MIDI groove .MID file.

- Multiple window, one window for one program, simply drag and drop a .PGM program file will open a new window for this program.


# Installation

Download the unique .jar directly from [Github](https://github.com/cyriux/mpcmaid/blob/master/MpcMaid/mpcmaid_beta.jar)

Double-click on it, MPC Maid must show. 

View the PDF documentation [here](https://github.com/cyriux/mpcmaid/blob/master/MpcMaid/documentation/MPCMaid_UserManual.pdf), or download it [here](https://github.com/cyriux/mpcmaid/raw/master/MpcMaid/documentation/MPCMaid_UserManual.pdf)


# Requirements

In Windows, if Winzip or Winrar tries to decompress the file this probably means you do not have Java installed yet. Go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp and download the JRE (1.6 update 12 at the time of writing) then follow the very simple instructions. In 2mn you can be done.

## Inspiration

MPC Maid is strongly inspired by the excellent [MPC Pad 187](http://mybunnyhug.com) by Stephen Norum, that is unfortunately not portable on other OS'es than Mac OS X.

## MPC1000 File Format

Based on the [extensive documentation](http://mybunnyhug.com/fileformats/pgm/) provided by Stephen Norum:

## Automatic Slicing

Beat detection follows the excellent guide ["Beat Detection Algorithms"](http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/beatdetection/) from Frédéric Patin:
